# Dataset
The dataset is really limited as you can see by the picture

But the prototype could work and be more functional with a bigger dataset...

# Model Type
The model is a VGG16 imported from the Keras library

# Model Accuracy/Loss
The results are not permanent.
The model could be trained on a bigger more wider dataset.
Implemented Data Augmentation to make the dataset bigger

This showcases that again with a bigger dataset with multiples pieces, angles, lighting we could have better, more accurate results
